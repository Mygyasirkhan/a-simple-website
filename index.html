  <p>The first computer was conceived as a machine of cogs and gears (Figure 1.1) but only became practical in the 1950s and 60s with the invention of semi-conductors. In the 1970s, a hardware company called IBM (footnote 1) emerged as the computing leader. In the 1980s, however, software became increasingly important, and by the 1990s a software company called Microsoft (footnote 2) had become the computing frontline leader by giving ordinary people tools like word-processing. During the 1990s computing became more personal, until the World-Wide-Web turned Internet URLs into web site names that people could read (footnote 3). A company called Google (footnote 4) then offered the ultimate personal service, free access to the vast public library we call the Internet, and soon everyone's gateway to the web was the new computing leader. In the 2000s computing evolved yet again, to become a social medium as well as a personal tool. So now Facebook challenges Google, as Google challenged Microsoft, and as Microsoft challenged IBM.</p>

  Yet to design a computer system one must define it, so what is computing? This deceptively simple question requires many answers because computing has re-invented itself every decade or so (Figure 1.2). What began as hardware became about software, then about users and is now about online communities. This chapter analyzes the evolution of computing as it impacts computing design.

  <p>First-generation computers were built using vacuum tubes as the main technology. These computers were very fragile and were as big as a room! They could roughly perform 5000 additions or subtractions per second! These computers consumed a lot of electricity and produced a lot of heat. The heat generated by the computer would also attract insects into the machine which would make the machine malfunction. This is why when computers have an error we still say “There’s a bug in it!”. These computers were used during the Second World War to calculate the aim of ballistic weapons and decode messages.</p>

  <p>Second-generation computers were built using transistors. Most of the development of transistors happened in Santa Clara Valley in the USA. And because transistors used silicon, this place was soon called Silicon Valley! Second-generation computers could perform roughly 5000 additions in a second but they were way more accurate! The only way to make transistor computers more powerful is to keep adding more transistors. This meant that a good transistor computer would need thousands of discrete parts to work well.

  <p>Third-generation computers used integrated circuits that were made by fitting many transistors onto one chip. The development of ICs also gave rise to Moore’s Law that believes that every two years, twice the number of transistors can be fitted into ICs while the cost of the ICs reduces by half. Since the circuits in the ICs are very close to each other, the electricity in the circuit needs to travel a very small distance. This led to faster calculations! The computer still needed an air-conditioned environment to function in.</p>
